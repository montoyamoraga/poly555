Almost there! Let's finish up.

:::caution
Take your time here. If the 3D-printed parts aren't fitting well together, don't force them -- you may accidentally break something. Instead, check for leftover support material that needs to be removed and gently carve it away with a utility knife.

## Steps

1. **Affix PCB**
   1. Slide 2 **square nuts** into the back PCB posts on the enclosure bottom half.
      [![Two square nuts in their posts](/img/assembly/nuts_in_enclosure_bottom.jpg)](/img/assembly/nuts_in_enclosure_bottom.jpg)
   2. Place the **finished PCB** into the enclosure bottom half, fitting the switch into its cavity.

   3. Slide **9v battery** into its space behind the speaker. It will be a tight fit.

   4. Fit **speaker** into its container ring above battery. Try to hide any excess wire from the speaker under the PCB.

   5. Secure PCB into place with 2 **1/4" screws**. Don't overtighten!

   6. Fit **volume wheel** onto **RV21**, matching its cavity to the trim pot's shape. As long as it's able to turn the underlying pot, it's okay if it's a little loose &mdash; it'll get held in place by the **enclosure top**.

2. **Add keys**
   1. Place **mounting rail** onto PCB, aligning its holes to the screw holes below.

   2. Place **keys** onto **mounting rail**.

3. **Finish enclosure**
   1. Insert 4 **square nuts** into the nut locks on the **enclosure top**. A small dab of glue here on each is optional but will help hold the nut in place the next time you disassemble.
      [![Inserting square nuts](/img/assembly/nuts_in_enclosure_top.jpg)](/img/assembly/nuts_in_enclosure_top.jpg)
   2. Remove protective film from **plexiglass window pane** and fit it into the **enclosure top**.
      [![Adding the plexiglass window pane](/img/assembly/plexiglass_window.jpg)](/img/assembly/plexiglass_window.jpg)
      - It _will_ fit but may be tight. If you're worried about breaking the **enclosure top**, you can use a utility knife to carefully trim down the two holder tabs to give the **plexiglass window pane** more room.
      - Alternatively, if it's too loose, let a line of glue dry in the long cavity under the nuts. Repeat until the fit is snug.
   3. We're about to lock it up, so now's a good time to make sure your POLY555 is fully [tuned](tuning) and has a good battery. Oh, clean any smudges off the inside window now too.
   4. Gently align the **two enclosure halves**, fitting the back hitches on the bottom into their matching cavities on the top.

   5. Srew 4 **1" screws** into the four mounting rail holes on the bottom of the enclosure. Don't overtighten!

Youâ€™re done!!

Take a selfie with your brand new and very incredible POLY555 synthesizer. Feel good! You're the best!!

### Feedback

When you can, please [let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it went for you:

* What did you like? Did you have fun?!
* Not including printing time, about how long did it take?
* Were there any parts missing or damaged?
* Any problems encountered with the instructions?
* Is there anything you'd change about the POLY555 itself?

I act and rely on customers' feedback to make future kits even better. Thank you so much!

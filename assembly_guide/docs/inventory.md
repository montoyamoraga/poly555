## What's Included in the Kit

:::note
While the values of the components and the layout of the PCB won't change, they may vary in appearance (ie, changing the brand of caps, different color/silkscreen PCB, wire colors, etc), so your kit's parts may look slightly different than what's pictured throughout the guide. That's just fine! Everything will work the same.

### Not Using the Kit?

If you're going the full open-source route and gathering all the parts by yourself, head over to the [POLY555 from Scratch](poly555-from-scratch) appendix, then come back here when you're done.

## What You'll Need

You'll need the following tools to assemble your POLY555:

### Required

- Soldering iron and solder for electronics
- Wire stripper or cutters
- Philips and flathead screwdrivers
- Chromatic instrument tuner or phone app
- Utility knife
- School glue
- 9v battery

### Recommended

- Multimeter for debugging
- PCB vice or “helping hands” holder
- “Solder sucker” or desoldering braid
- Tweezers or “dentist’s tools” for working with small components
- Windex
- Patience, patience, patience

:::tip
Give yourself plenty of time to put this together, at least 5 hours. There are a lot of components and things to solder!

I like to spread it out throughout the day and take lots of breaks!

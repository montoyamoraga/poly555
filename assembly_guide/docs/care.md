- Clean the plexiglass window pane with regular window cleaner.
- The trim potentiometers will hold their positions and the 555 chip is similarly resilient, but the POLY555 is an analog instrument and will lose tune over time. That's expected! [Re-tune normally](tuning.md).
- 3D-printed plastic is susceptible to warping under hot temperatures. Keep it out of prolonged direct sunlight.
- When the POLY555 seems especially out of tune, overly distorted, or doesn't turn on at all, that's a sign that its 9v battery doesn't have enough voltage. Open up the enclosure and replace it.
